# opg-data-casrec-migration

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to house all the code that we will use to perform the casrec to sirius migration.
The original discovery recommended AWS Glue & pyspark to transform the data set into a form that can then be
injested / inserted into Sirius platform.

However our approach (as well as this readme) will develop over time!
